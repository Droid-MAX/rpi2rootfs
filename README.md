# who need this tool?
I bought raspberry pi not for learning anything, I want to use it as a server. It 
may be a router, or help me to control other hardward. But image supplied by official website,
with GUI, and so many softwares I never use. for these software, I have to prepare a huge TF card,
at least 8G. I have a TF card with only 4G space, I can't install system NOOB, raspbian depend on 
jessie, only raspbian depend on wheezy can run on it, but the system is too old. This made me very unhappy.
So I found this project, the basic system generate by it only need 1G space. If you think the same thing as me,
try these scripts, if you want to teach your kids programming, go to buy a new TF card.

If you want to run raspberry pi only as a router, maybe you should try openwrt. The newest version 15.05
support raspberry pi and raspberry pi 2.
